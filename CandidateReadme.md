# Hello!

And thanks for being part of our technical assessment.

A few environment requirements to set you up for success. We want you to have the smoothest expereince possible, and if any of these are a problem for you (or you don't want to install local files), please let us know and we can offer a cloud based alternative!

* Ensure pnpm is installed globally: `npm i -g pnpm`

* Ensure  your node version is 16+

* Clone the repo `git clone {repo_URL}`

* cd into the repo `cd intervue`

* Install dependencies `pnpm i`

* Start your local dev environment with one of these commands:
    * `pnpm run vanilla`

    or

    * `pnpm run vue-tech`
